 # TexTron Snake
 
 TexTron Snake is a very simple ASCII snake game tributed to the classic
 Tron arcade. It was meant to be developed as a collaborative programming
 exercise in a course on Open Source Systems taught to undergraduate CS
 students.

 ## INSTALL

 If you have obtained the project source from the __version control repository__,

 execute the script 

 ```
 $ ./autogen.sh
 ```

to boostrap the build configuration script `configure`. To that end, you'll 
need to have GNU Build System (Autotools) installed. In debian/ubuntu based 
platforms,  you may install required software with

```
$ sudo apt install automake autoconf
```

On the other hand, if you have obtained the software form a __distribution 
repository__, usually as a tarball, you should already have the  script `configure`.

Either way, locate the file in the root of source directory and execute it

```
 $ ./configure
```

This script shall perform a series of tests to collect data about the build 
platform. If it complains about missing pieces of software, install them 
as needed.

For instance, you'll need `libncurses`, which in debian/ubuntu may be
installed with

```
sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
```

Support for POSIX thread is also required.

Finally, build the software and install it with

```
 $ make
 $ make install
```

This should install the program under the system path. Usually the binary
will be placed in `/usr/bin`, and data files in `/usr/share`. Administrative
privileges (sudo) are required to write in those locations.



Optionally, if you wish to install the software under a different location,
 for instance, in `/tmp/foo`, execute

```
 $ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/foo
 $ make
 $ make install
```

This shall install the software locally, in this case in `/tmp/foo/bin`
and the data files in `/tmp/share`. 

 For more detailed instructions, please, refer to file `INSTALL`

## EXECUTION

```
 Usage:  ttsnake [options]

         Options
         
	 -h, --help      Displays this information message
	 -d, --data      Selects a non-default data path
```

 ## Playing the game
 
 The game takes place on a rectangular arena where a snake continuously
 moves in one of the four directions: left, right, up and down --- it never 
 stops. As the snake moves, it loses energy, and if all of it is exausted, the
 snake dies. To recover energy, the snake needs to eat pieces of food which
 are constantly replaced at random positions. 

Be careful, though. The arena borders are electrified and will kill the snake
if touched. Moreover, mind that the snake is poisonous and it would also die if 
it accidently bites itself, i.e. if the snake's head crosses its own body (yes, 
this is weird for snakes, but this is a Tron Snake).

The game score is the count of eaten blocks until the game is over.

 ### Controls:
	W, A, S and D to control the snake
	+ to increase the game speed
	- to decrease the game speed 
	Q to quit the game
	R at anytime to restart the game
